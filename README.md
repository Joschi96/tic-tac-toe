# Tic Tac Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game that you can play in your browser.
Created while doing The Odin Project.

This project aims to utilize the recently learned methods in JS, including Factory Functions and Module Patterns, as well as the concept of conclusion.
The goal is to have as little global code as possible.
